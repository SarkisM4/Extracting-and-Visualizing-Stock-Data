# Extracting-and-Visualizing-Stock-Data


In this project, I am using web scraping and the yfinance library from Python in order to extract stock data and revenue from Tesla and GameStop stocks. 
By the end, with all the data and revenue acquired, we can then visualize them onto a graph using the make_graph function.
